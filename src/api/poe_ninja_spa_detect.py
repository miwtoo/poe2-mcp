"""
poe.ninja SPA detection (Issue #61).

Patch 0.5 (2026-05-29) migrated poe.ninja's builds/character pages from
SvelteKit (with embedded `window.__NUXT__` / `window.__data` JSON) to an
Astro-rendered client-side SPA. The new HTML responses are 200 OK but
contain no embedded build data — all content loads via runtime XHR.

This module isolates the detection logic so:
  1. The scraper in poe_ninja_api.py can distinguish "SPA shell, no data"
     from "real data, parse failed" and surface that distinction.
  2. Unit tests can exercise the detection without pulling in the full
     poe_ninja_api module (which loads BeautifulSoup, httpx, etc.).
  3. When/if poe.ninja's new build-data endpoint shape is discovered,
     this module is the single place to update.

Lives outside the MCP heavy-import graph (no SQLAlchemy / no mcp_server)
per the light-module pattern (PR #123 / #124 / #125).
