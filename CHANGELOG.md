## Version 1.0.2 (2026-05-31) - Patch 0.5 game data + MCP usability sweep

Follow-up to 1.0.1. Where 1.0.1 was non-extraction code compat for the 0.5 patch, 1.0.2 ships the actual extracted 0.5 game data + MCP-handler improvements + accuracy work surfaced during a fresh end-to-end MCP evaluation.

--- Game Data (canonical layout) ---
* Establish `data/game/{dataset}/` repo-as-source-of-truth layout (#69). 5 datasets shipped: mods (16,788 records), passive_tree (9,605 nodes, 82 keystones, 2,151 notables), support_gems (680), ascendancies (37 — including NEW 0.5 Spirit Walker + Martial Artist), stats (26,943 stat IDs). Closes #53 (pip install empty database).
* Inline-resolve `stat_id` strings on every non-empty mod stat entry (#75). 24,632 entries enriched. Consumers no longer need to load `stats.json` separately to resolve `stat_key` references.
* Fix ascendancy `display_name` field — use canonical offset 44 instead of longest-string heuristic (#71). 23 active ascendancies all correctly named.

--- MCP Tools ---
* Add `check_tree_freshness` self-diagnostic tool (#76). Compares local `data/game/version.json` patch_version against poe.ninja's current `PassiveTree` tag from index-state. Reports current / behind / ahead / unable. Pure change-detection per data policy. Tool count: 39 → 40.
* Rewrite `search_mods_by_stat` (#73). Was returning 0 results for "life regeneration" despite 16,788 mods in DB. Now tokenizes the query and searches mod_id + display_name + resolved stat_id strings. Verified: "life regeneration" goes from 0 hits to 173 hits (117 mod_id + 56 stat cross-reference).
* Accept alias parameter names on `inspect_keystone` (`name`), `inspect_spell_gem` (`name`, `gem_name`), `validate_support_combination` (`support_gem_names`, `names`) via `oneOf` in inputSchema (#73). AI-friendliness fix from the May eval.
* SPA-aware character-fetch error templates on `analyze_character` and `compare_to_top_players` (#74). Surfaces the CRITICAL #4 (#61) poe.ninja SPA migration cause up front instead of sending users on a wild-goose chase through profile-privacy and account-format settings. Closes #55 (@dsakura).

--- API ---
* Auto-discover league slug from index-state when `LEAGUE_MAPPINGS` is stale (#62, in 1.0.1 retro). Future leagues work as soon as poe.ninja indexes them, without needing a static map update.

--- Knowledge ---
* Add `Runic Ward` `explain_mechanic` entry (#64, in 1.0.1 retro). PRELIMINARY — numeric mechanics not bundled (waiting on .datc64 mechanics extraction). Documents what we know, what's pending.

--- Documentation ---
* Split Claude Desktop config in README into pip-install (`"command": "poe2-mcp"`) vs source-install (`launch.py`) sub-options (#72). Closes #52.

--- Known Issues (carried over from 1.0.1) ---
* CRITICAL #4: poe.ninja builds-list / ladder SPA migration broke `compare_to_top_players` and HTML-scrape fallback (#61). Per-character JSON API still works for characters in the snapshot; #74 + #65 surface the cause to users instead of silent fail. Underlying fix needs the new poe.ninja endpoint reverse-engineered.
* `skill_gems` dataset not yet in `data/game/` — blocked on PoB2 community shipping 0.5 `tree.json` upstream (verified daily; still not landed as of 2026-05-31). Current pre-0.5 skill data in `data/pob_active_skills.json`.

## Version 1.0.1 (2026-05-30) - Patch 0.5 "Return of the Ancients" Compatibility

Compatibility updates for PoE2 Patch 0.5 (released 2026-05-29). Code-level fixes that work without re-extracted game data. Local passive tree and item mod data remain stale pending `.datc64` re-extraction; see Known Issues below.

--- API ---
* Add Runes of Aldur league (+ HC/SSF/HCSSF variants) to `LEAGUE_MAPPINGS` (#59). Slugs confirmed via `/poe2/api/data/index-state`: `runesofaldur`, `runesofaldurhc`, `runesofaldurssf`, `runesofaldurhcssf`
* Update default league from stale "Abyss" to "Runes of Aldur" on `get_character` and `_scrape_character_page` (#59)
* Auto-discover league slug from index-state when `LEAGUE_MAPPINGS` is stale, so future leagues work before the static map is updated (#62)

--- Calculators ---
* Stub `runic_ward` field on `DefensiveStats` for PoE2 0.5 Verisium Runeforging defense layer (#59). Not yet layered into mitigation; requires local extraction

--- Knowledge ---
* Add `Martial Artist` (Monk) and `Spirit Walker` (Huntress) to `ASCENDANCY_TO_CLASS` (#59). Class mapping only; node data pending re-extraction
* Commit `src/parsers/ascendancy_resolver.py` as a tracked module (#59). Was previously imported by `mcp_server.py` but untracked, so fresh checkouts would fail to import

--- Bug Fixes ---
* Fix pip console entry-point `poe2-mcp` invoking async `main()` without `asyncio.run()` (#60). Closes #56 (@MagicJoseph)

--- Documentation ---
* Correct README tool count from 32 to 39 and document the live Path of Building bridge (`pob_*` tools) (#58)

--- Infrastructure ---
* Bump vite 7.3.1 to 7.3.3 in /web (#50, dependabot)
* Bump postcss 8.5.6 to 8.5.14 in /web (#51, dependabot)

--- Known Issues (extraction-dependent, not in this release) ---
* CRITICAL: poe.ninja builds-list / ladder SPA migration broke `compare_to_top_players` and the HTML-scrape fallback (#61). Per-character JSON API still works but returns 404 for characters not present in the snapshot version (excludes freshly-rolled characters)
* Local passive tree pre-0.5: 16.21% miss rate measured vs poe.ninja's `PassiveTree-0.5` asset (4,480 nodes; local 4,094). Pending `.datc64` re-extraction
* Ascendancy node data stale for 6 reworked ascendancies + 2 new ones; mapping in place, node data pending re-extraction
* Item mod DB missing Runic Ward / Runeforging mods; pending re-extraction
* `runic_ward` field exists on `DefensiveStats` but is not layered into `calculate_ehp`; pending mechanics extraction
