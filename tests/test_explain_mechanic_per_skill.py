"""
Tests for the per-skill consult tier added to explain_mechanic (task #82).

Closes the follow-up from PR #129 (per-skill .csd extraction). After this
change, explain_mechanic walks four tiers:

  1a    - exact stat_id match in root-level canonical stat_descriptions
  1a-bis - exact match in per-skill bundle (NEW)
  2     - hand-authored mechanics_kb
  1b    - substring search across BOTH canonical sources (root + per-skill)
  miss  - all-tier exhausted message

Two test modes:
  - Helper-direct tests verify the per-skill helpers (already covered by PR
    #129's tests — light spot-check here that they're still wired).
  - Handler tests (methodology-rule-compliant lazy fixture) verify
    explain_mechanic surfaces per-skill records when a stat_id only exists
    in the per-skill bundle.
