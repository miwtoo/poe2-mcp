"""
Tests for the canonical support-gems load path added to fresh_data_provider.

Background: prior to this PR, FreshDataProvider loaded support gems exclusively
from data/complete_models/support_gems.json (551 entries, pre-Patch-0.5). The
post-0.5 .datc64-extracted canonical dataset at
data/game/support_gems/support_gems.json (680 entries) was ignored — so
inspect_support_gem("Wildfire") returned "not found" even though Wildfire is
present in the canonical extraction.

This suite locks the fix:
  1. Canonical file is preferred when present.
  2. Schema translation ('name' -> 'display_name') happens on load so existing
     lookups keep working.
  3. Lookups by name find post-0.5 additions (Wildfire) AND pre-0.5 entries
     that existed under both schemas (Wildshards) — no regressions.
