"""
Tests for the P2 / Issue #115 fuzzy-match + did-you-mean recovery wired into
inspect_keystone, inspect_support_gem, inspect_spell_gem.

Two test modes:
  - Helper-direct tests exercise the did_you_mean() free function in
    src/mcp_server.py against the real canonical name pools. These don't need
    MCP init and run anywhere — they lock the matcher contract.
  - Handler tests invoke the three inspect_* handlers via the
    methodology-rule-compliant lazy-fixture pattern (PR #120). Verifies the
    response shape on miss includes "Did you mean:" with concrete candidates.

The lazy fixture pattern matters: pytest collection has been observed to
hang on `from src.mcp_server import ...` at module-load time on some
configurations. Importing inside the fixture (not at module top) keeps the
helper-direct tests collectible regardless.
